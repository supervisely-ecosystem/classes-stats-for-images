## Overview 

Data Exploration for Segmentation and Detection tasks is underestimated by many researchers. The accuracy of your models highly depends on how good you understand data. 

This app **"Classes Stats for Images"** generates report with detailed general and per image statistics for all classes in images project. It allows to see big picture as well as shed light on hidden patterns and edge cases (see <a href="#how-to-use">How to use</a> section).


## How To Run

### Step 1: Run from context menu of project / dataset

Go to "Context Menu" (images project or dataset) -> "Report" -> "Classes stats for images"

### Step 2: Configure running settings

Choose the percentage of images that should be randomly sampled. By default all images will be used. And then press "Run" button. In advanced settings you can change agent that will host the app and change version (latest available version is used by default).

Fields:
* `IMAGE ID` - image id in Supervisely Instance
* `IMAGE` - image name with direct link to annotation tool. You can use table to find some anomalies or edge cases in your data by sorting different columns and then quickly open images with annotations to investigate deeper.
